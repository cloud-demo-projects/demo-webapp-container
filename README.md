Introduction

This is a very simple SpringBoot application project highlighting how can we work out a Springboot web dependency project all the way to Azure webapp.

Steps followed-

1. Downloaded the Springboot skelton from Spring initializer with web dependency, Java 8 & Maven
2. Imported in IDE (Eclipse) and made a simple Rest controller to return text on root request
3. Tested the project locally
4. Add & populate the dockerfile
5. Build & Test the docker container OR you might want to use a build plugin to Build a Docker Image with Maven
6. Deployed the project in Azure subscription through authenticated client (Azure CLI)
7. Aha! We are done, verified !
